# Node Site Start

A starter kit to build website designs out using Node, Express, EJS, Grunt, and LiveReload.

With this repo you have a quick development environment for building out site designs.

## Requirements

- node and npm
- grunt: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

## Installation

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the server: `grunt`
- View in browser: `http://localhost:8080`

## LiveReload

When saving EJS, CSS, or JS, your site will automatically reload on save. This speeds up development time.

You will need to include this script in your HTML:

    <script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
